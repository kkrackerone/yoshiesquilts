                <h1> Story of Japanese Orphanage</h1>

                <p> Some years ago I watched TV show about two years old girl getting adopted from orphanage in Japan to
                    American couple. Kids who live in the orphanage get at least one person to take care of as a
                    caregiver.
                    This
                    girl was so attached to the caregiver. The day when she departed to America with the American
                    couple,
                    she
                    was so sad to say bye to her caregiver since this caregiver was the only one who took care of her
                    just
                    like
                    her own mom. This happens all kids or babies who live at the orphanage. They have to be separated by
                    those
                    who take care of them for a year or two years since they cannot stay there more than two years. I
                    felt
                    so
                    sorry for those kids who have to have the experience at the early age. I wanted those kids to know
                    that
                    someone care for them always by giving a quilt. I contacted with the orphanage and see if I can make
                    a
                    quilt
                    for kids. They so welcomed to receive my quilt. I have been making a quilt for kids or babies who
                    are
                    adapted and leave the orphanage for almost two years. I get pictures and letters from couples who
                    receive my
                    quilt with their adapted kids or babies. I love making a quilt for kids who donâ€™t get a good start
                    of
                    their
                    lives, but they have a bright future with love I can give and more people around them can give.

                    This is the TV show I watched. The day she is leaving for her new place with her new mom. </p>
