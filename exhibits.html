            <p>Yoshie takes great pride in being able to display her masterpieces in local exhibits. It allows her
                to
                share the story of each quilt, and gives others the opportunity to see them.</p>

                    <p>When my daughter wanted to start her own business to sell quilt kits, she
                        asked me to make quilts for her kits.This is the first quilt we made together.
                        Unfortunately, her business
                        didn't go well and she quit selling quilt kits. My daughter and I had such a fun time
                        together creating quilts to
                        sell.
                        This quilt reminds us that mothers and daughters can create beautiful things when we are
                        together.</p>
