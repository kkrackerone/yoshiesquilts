                        <h2>Mother & Daughter's Colors on the Canvas 2021</h2>

                        <p2>When my daughter wanted to start her own business to sell quilt kits, she
                            asked me to make quilts for her kits.This is the first quilt we made together.
                            Unfortunately, her business
                            didn't go well and she quit selling quilt kits. My daughter and I had such a fun time
                            together creating quilts to
                            sell.
                            This quilt reminds us that mothers and daughters can create beautiful things when we are
                            together.</p2>

                    <p2>After I saw a pattern for this quilt on a website, I wanted to make it. I loved how the
                        colors
                        combined so well together. I decided to use two main colors and rearrange the pattern the
                        way I
                        wanted to. Weaving the colors reminds me of how we can make harmony in our lives. We are all
                        different, but we can make this world beautiful when we get together as we weave our own
                        colors
                        together. My meassage with this quilt is that each of us have important parts in this
                        beautiful
                        world. Let's keep shining our beautiful colors! </p2>
